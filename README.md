So I’m a noob. I’ve been programming for years, I’ve messed around with LAMP-stack application development a little, but most of my experience stems from being safely nestled in the corporate Microsoft-dominated world of Visual Studio and .Net.

I have a confession to make, though. I like rails.

Ruby is elegant, exotic, fascinating. Rails is sexy. It’s almost the software development equivalent of infidelity. Now I’ve dressed the old architecture up to look like Rails, but cheap lingerie and too much makeup doesn’t do the trick. Really, ASP.Net MVC 2.0 is looking pretty hot these days, but it’s a corporate reaction to what the Rails community has already done; there’s no innovation there, only imitation.

So, I’ve done what you’ve probably done. I’ve googled my keycaps shiny, looking at resources, references, endless blog posts, a deluge of screencasts, and I’ve spent more time on GitHub than the developers. And still, I don’t know a thing. Oh, I can generate the scaffolding for a blog. Everybody shows you how to do that. What I need, though, is a step-by-step process for building a real-world application. I can’t find anything like that; I guess it’d take too long to put together.

So, I’m going to document, here, the construction of a typical content-management sort of application, with users, roles, content articles, plugins, reports, tests, bugs, mistakes, bad design, failures, faults, and embarrassing struggles with things that are much simpler than I thought they were.

And you get to watch
