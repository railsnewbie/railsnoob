# I have a hard time keeping track of all the generators and rake tasks
# that need to be run to get things going. So I'm logging that stuff here
# as a reference, roughly in the order it's being run

# install test frameworks
script/generate rspec
script/generate cucumber

# create databases
rake db:create:all
rake db:sessions:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:clone
